Deep Fried Oreo Cookies

1 package of Oreo Cookies
1 1/2- 1 3/4 cup Bisquick Baking Mix
1 cup So Delicious Original Coffee Creamer
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 cup vegetable oil (for frying)
Confectioners sugar (for sprinkling)

Mix the Bisquick Baking Mix and Coffee creamer together to form a thick batter.  I started with a single cup of Bisquick and slowly added more until the batter was a nice thick consistency.  I estimate this to be between 1 and 1/2 cups and 1 and 3/4 cups.  Add the vanilla and stir well.

In a saute pan heat oil until it is very hot but not smoking.  Roll the Oreo cookies in the batter until well coated.  Drop into the hot oil and fry quickly on each side until golden brown (you could use a deep fryer as well). 

Remove from the oil and place on a paper towel to drain.  Plate and sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Eat while still warm.
